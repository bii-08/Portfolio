# Hello üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I'm a self-taught freelance iOS Developer.
This repo serves as a portfolio of projects I'm currently working on. Please take a look around.

This is the latest app I built and released on the App Store. The idea for this app came from my interest in helping English learners (myself as well) improve their language skills through reading news and stories.<br />
<br />
The app features an instant word lookup, allowing users to simply tap on any word to reveal its definition, save words to their own word books, and review them effectively later.<br />
<br />

<br />
The 15 Puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered tiles in random order with one tile missing.<br />
The goal of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.<br />
<br />
I built this app with 2 types of games for users to choose from: a classic game with numbered tiles and a picture game with a hints feature.

# Hello üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I'm a self-taught freelance iOS Developer.
This repo serves as a portfolio of projects I'm currently working on. Please take a look around.

## iOS Applications
### Owl Reader

![Interface](https://img.shields.io/badge/Interface-SwiftUI-yellow)
![Architecture](https://img.shields.io/badge/Architecture-MVVM-green)
![Data Persistence](https://img.shields.io/badge/Data_Persistence-SwiftData-blue)
![Languages](https://img.shields.io/badge/Languages-8-orange)
![Supported Divices](https://img.shields.io/badge/Supported_Divices-iPhone%2C_iPad-orange?color=violet)<br />
<br />
This is the latest app I built and released on the App Store. The idea for this app came from my interest in helping English learners (myself as well) improve their language skills through reading news and stories.<br />
<br />
The app features an instant word lookup, allowing users to simply tap on any word to reveal its definition, save words to their own word books, and review them effectively later.<br />
<br />
See more documentation about this project and the code [here](https://github.com/bii-08/Bookworm)

Do you ever have a problem where you forget your food and it expires without you knowing? <br />
<br />
Waste Not is an app designed to help you track the expiry dates of your goods. Stay organized and ensure your items never go to waste with timely notifications and quick glances through widgets. <br />

### The 15 Puzzle

<br />
<br />
The 15 Puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered tiles in random order with one tile missing.<br />
The goal of the puzzle is to place the tiles in order by making sliding moves that use the empty space.<br />
<br />
I built this app with 2 types of games for users to choose from: a classic game with numbered tiles and a picture game with a hints feature.
<br />
<br />

### Avid Cook

![Architecture](https://img.shields.io/badge/Architecture-MVVM-green)
<br />
<br />
Avid Cook is a recipe app that lets you explore thousands of recipes through a search bar or choose from our everyday Top Picks. <br />
Save your favorite recipes for quick access later, or add ingredients to your shopping list with a single tap.<br />
I built this app using the API from spoonacular.com to practice my skills with the intention of turning it into a commercial product in the near future.
<br />
<br />

I created [my personal blog](https://bii-08.github.io/) using John Sundell's [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) framework and deployed it on GitHub Pages to share my experiences working with `Swift` and `SwiftUI`.
